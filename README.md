# Movie-Website-using-JavaScript
This project is to create a movie website for TMDB (like IMDB) using JavaScript and AJAX. Web Service REST API is used to access the TMDB database. The database results were returned in JSON for processing the output display. Please note that, this project has been deployed in a private server called Omega, so you might need to modify the deployment details as per your needs.
